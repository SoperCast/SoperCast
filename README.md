### 🚀 About Me

I'm a Data Scientist with more than four years of experience developing and deploying Machine Learning, GenAI, and NLP models to solve real-world business problems. My interdisciplinary background combines engineering, analytics, and artificial intelligence to design impactful, scalable, and strategic data solutions.

I've led initiatives that reduced operational defects by 50%, forecasted pharmaceutical sales, predicted patient recovery times, and automated job posting creation using AI—all contributing to data-driven decision-making across industries such as healthcare, education, manufacturing, and pharma.
